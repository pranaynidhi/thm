Note to self. General super spam mentioned that I should not make the same mistake again of re-using the same key for the XOR encryption of our messages to Alpha Solaris IV's headquarters, otherwise we could have some serious issues if our encrypted messages are compromised. I must keep reminding myself,do not re-use keys,I have done it 8 times already!.The most important messages we sent to the HQ were the first and eighth message.I hope they arrived safely.They are crucial to our end goal.
